Padilla~\cite{Padilla2011} performed a detailed one dimensional numerical heat transfer analysis of a PTC (Parabolic Trough Collector).  To solve the mathematical model of heat transfer of the PTC model, the partial differential equations were discretized and the nonlinear algebraic equations were solved simultaneously. The numerical results was validated to the data from Sandia National Laboratory (SNL).
\nomenclature[C]{PTC}{Parabolic Trough Collector}
\nomenclature[C]{SNL}{Sandia National Laboratory}

To understand the thermal performance of the collector and identify the heat losses from the collector, Mohamad~\cite{Mohamad2014} analyzed the temperature variation of the working fluid, tube and glass along the collector.

Guo~\cite{JiangfengGuo2016-1} investigated the energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the parabolic trough collector. The result shown that there exists an optimal mass flow rate of working fluid for exergy efficiency, and the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency have opposite changing tendencies under some conditions.

Guo~\cite{JiangfengGuo2016-2} implemented a multi-parameter optimization of parabolic trough solar receiver based on genetic algorithm where Exergy and thermal efficiencies were employed as objective function.

Padilla~\cite{Padilla2014} performed a comprehensive exergy balance of a parabolic trough collector based on the previous heat transfer model~\cite{Padilla2011}. The results shown that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid, solar irradiance, and vacuum in annulus have a significant effect on the thermal and exergetic performance, but the effect of wind speed and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid is negligible. It was obtained that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid cannot be optimized to achieve simultaneously maximum thermal and exergetic efficiency because they exhibit opposite trends. Finally, it was found that the highest exergy destruction is due to the heat transfer between the sun and the absorber while for exergy losses is due to optical error.

Huang~\cite{Huang2012} proposed an analytical model for optical performance which employed a modified integration algorithm.

Wang~\cite{Wang2016} proposed a mathematical model for the optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collector and selected three typical regions of solar thermal utilization in China for the model. The model is validated by comparing the test results in parabolic trough power plant, with relative error range of 1\% to about 5\%.

Al-Sulaiman~\cite{AlSulaiman2014} presented the exergy analysis of selected thermal power systems driven by PTSCs. The power pf the thermal power system is produced using either a steam Rankine cycle (SRC) or a combined cycle, in which the SRC is the topping cycle and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is the bottoming cycle.

\nomenclature[C]{ORC}{Organic Rankine Cycle}

Hachicha~\cite{Hachicha2013} presented a detailed numerical heat transfer model based on the finite volume method for the parabolic trough collector.  This model is based on finite volume method and ray trace techniques and takes into account the finite size of the Sun.  The model is thoroughly validated with results from the literature and it shows a good agreement with experimental and analytical results.

Ashouri~\cite{Ashouri2015} coupled a small scale parabolic trough collector and a thermal storage tank along with an auxiliary heater to a Kalina cycle to study the performance of the system throughout the year, both thermodynamically and economically.

Guo~\cite{SuGuo2016} developed a nonlinear distribution parameter model to model the dynamic behaviors of direct steam generation parabolic trough collector loops under either full or partial solar irradiance disturbance.

Bader~\cite{Bader2015} developed a numerical model of a tubular vavity-receiver that uses air as the heat transfer fluid. Four different receiver configurations are considered, with smooth or V-corrugated absorber tube and single- or double-glazed aperture window. The different types of energy loss by the collector have been quantified, and the temperature distribution inside the receiver has been studied. The pumping power required to pump the HTF through the receiver has been determined for a 200 m long collector row.

Good~\cite{Good2015} proposed solar trough concentrators using air as heat transfer fluid at operating temperatures exceeding $600\,^\circ$C. It consists of an array of helically coiled absorber tubes contained side-by-side within an insulated groove having a rectangular windowed opening. Secondary concentrating optics are incorporated to boost the geometric concentration ratio to 97$\times$.

Boukelia~\cite{Boukelia2016} investigated the feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm with three different variants; Levenberge Marguardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), and Pola-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (PCG), used in artificial neural network (ANN) to find the best approach for prediction and techno-economic optimization of parabolic trough solar thermal power plant (PTSTPP) integrated with fuel backup system and thermal energy storage.

Kaloudis~\cite{Kaloudis2016} investigated a PTC system with nanofluid as the HTF in terms of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Syltherm 800 liquid oil was used as the HTF, and Al$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles with the concentrations ranges from 0\% to 4\% was investigated. A boost up to 10\% on the collector efficiency was reported for Al$_2$O$_3$ concentration of 4\%.

\nomenclature[C]{CFD}{Computational Fluid Dynamics}

Tan~\cite{Tan2014} proposed a two-stage photovoltaic thermal system based on solar trough concentration is proposed, in which the metal cavity heating stage is added on the basis of the PV/T stage, and thermal energy with higher temperature is output while electric energy is output. The experimental platform of the two-stage photovoltaic thermal system was established, with a 1.8 m$^2$ mirror PV/T stage and a 15 m$^2$ mirror heating stage, or a 1.8 m$^2$ mirror PV/T stage and a 30 m$^2$ mirror heating stage. The results showed that with single cycle, the long metal cavity heating stage would bring lower thermal efficiency, but temperature rise of the working medium is higher, up to 12.06$^\circ$C with only single cycle. With 30 min closed multiple cycles, the temperature of the working medium in the water tank was 62.8$^\circ$C, with an increase of 28.7$^\circ$C, and thermal energy with higher temperature could be output.

Al-Sulaiman~\cite{AlSulaiman2012} proposed a novel system based on PTC and ORC for combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP). Performance assessment, including efficiency, net electrical power, and electrical to heating and cooling ratios, of the system shown that when CCHP is used, the efficiency increases significantly. This study reveals that the maximum electrical efficiency for the solar mode is 15\%, for the solar and storage mode is 7\%, and for the storage mode is 6.5\%. The maximum CCHP efficiency for the solar mode is 94\%, for the solar and storage mode is 47\%, and for the storage mode is 42\%.
\nomenclature[C]{CCHP}{Combined cooling, heating and power}

Lobon~\cite{Lobon2014} introduced a computational fluid dynamic simulation approach to predict the behavior of a solar steam generating system, which is located at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain. The CFD package STAR-CCM+ code has been used to implement an efficient multiphase model capable of simulating the dynamics of the multiphase fluid in parabolic-trough solar collectors. Numerical and experimental data are compared in a wide range of working conditions.
\nomenclature[C]{DSG}{Direct Steam Generation}

Xu~\cite{Xu2014} presented a method to compensate the end loss effect of PTC. An optical analysis on the end loss effect of PTC with horizontal north-south axis (PTC-HNSA) is performed and a five-meter PTC-HNSA experimental system was built. The increased thermal efficiency of the experimental system is measured, and the result that the experimental value (increased thermal efficiency) substantially agreed with the theoretical value (increased optical efficiency) is gained.

Liu~\cite{Liu2012} developed a mathematical model of PTC using the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) method. Numerical simulations are implemented to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of the LSSVM method, where the sample data derived from the experiment and the simulation results of two solar collector systems with 30 m$^2$ and 600 m$^2$ solar fields, and the complicated relationship between the solar collector efficiency and the solar flux, the flow rate and the inlet temperature of the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is extracted.
\nomenclature[C]{LSSVM}{Least squares support vector machine}

\section{Solar Parabolic dish}\label{sec:pd}

One of the main goals of the BIOSTIRLING-4SKA project, funded by the European Commission, is the development of a hybrid Dish-Stirling system based on a hybrid solar-gas receiver, which has been designed by the Swedish company Cleanergy.~\cite{Blazquez2016}

Craig~\cite{Craig2016b} proposed two types of cooking sections of the solar parabolic dish system: the spiral hot plate copper tube and the heat pipe plate. A conical cavity of copper tubes were put on the focus of the collectors to collect heat and the heat is stored inside an insulated tank which acts both as storage and cooking plate. The use of heat pipes to transfer heat between the oil storage and the cooking pot was compared to the use of a direct natural syphon principle which is achieved using copper tubes in spiral form like electric stove. An accurate theoretical analysis for the heat pipe cooker was achieved by solving the boiling and vaporization in the evaporator side and then balancing it with the condensation and liquid-vapour interaction in the condenser part while correct heat transfer, pressure and height balancing was calculated in the second experiment. The results show and compare the cooking time, boiling characteristics, overall utilization efficiencies and necessary comparison between the two system and other existing systems.

Flux distribution of the receiver is simulated successfully by Mao~\cite{Mao2014b} using MCRT method. The impacts of incident solar irradiation, aspect ratio (the ratio of the receiver height to the receiver diameter), and system error on the radiation flux of the receiver are investigated.
\nomenclature[C]{MCRT}{Monte Carlo Ray Tracing}

Mawire~\cite{Mawire2014} investigated the thermal performance of a cylindrical cavity receiver for an SK-14 parabolic dish concentrator. The receiver exergy rates and efficiencies are found to be appreciably smaller than the receiver energy rates and efficiencies. The exergy factor is found to be high under conditions of high solar radiation and under high operating temperatures. An optical efficiency of around 52\% for parabolic dish system is determined under high solar radiation conditions.

Reddy~\cite{Reddy2015,Reddy2015_2} performed the theoretical thermal performance analysis of a fuzzy focal solar parabolic dish concentrator with modified cavity receiver. Total heat loss from the modified cavity receiver is estimated considering the effects of wind conditions, operating temperature, emissivity of the cavity cover and thickness of insulation. Time constant test was carried out to determine the influence of sudden change in solar radiation at steady state conditions. The daily performance tests were conducted for different flow rates.

Vikram~\cite{Vikram2015} investigated the total heat losses of modified cavity receiver of SPD with three configurations using 3D numerical model. The effects of various parameters such as diameter ratio, angle of inclination, operating temperature, insulation thickness and emissivity of the cavity cover on the heat losses from the modified vavity receiver are investigated. An ANN model is developed to predict the heat loss for a large set of influencing parameters. Based on ANN modeling, improved Nusselt number correlations are proposed for convective, radiative and total heat losses from the modified cavity receiver. The convective heat losses are greatly influenced by receiver inclination whereas the radiation heat losses are influenced by the cavity cover emissivity. The diameter ratio also plays a major role in heat losses from the cavity receiver. The present method predicts the heat losses more accurately compared with the existing models.

Atul~\cite{Atul2015} proposed a low-cost solar dish water heating system and investigated the effect of variation of mass flow rate on performance of the heater prototype. A novel truncated cone-shaped helical coiled receiver made up of copper is put at the focal point of SP.

CRTEn developed a solar parabolic concentrator (SPC) using four types of absorbers: flat plat, disk, water calorimeter and solar heat exchanger.~\cite{Skouri2013} For the system different types of absorbers, experiments were conducted to obtain the mean concentration ratio and both energy and exergy efficiency. Results shown that thermal energy efficiency of the system varies from 40\% to 77\%, the concentrating system reaches an average exergy efficiency of 50\% and a concentration factor around 178.

\nomenclature[C]{SPC}{Solar parabolic concentrator}

Blazquez~\cite{Blazquez2016} studied the optimization of the concentrator and receiver cavity geometry of parabolic dish system. Ray-tracing analysis has been performed with the open source software Tonatiuh, a ray-tracing tool specifically oriented to the modeling of solar concentrators.

Uma~\cite{Uma2015} carried out the simulation of the structural, thermal and CFD analysis of the dish with varying metallic properties (Aluminium, Copper and StainlessSteel) under different wind conditions. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was done to simulate the thermal performance of the dish at two different wind velocities.

Patil~\cite{Patil2016} described the development of automatic dual axis solar tracking system for solar parabolic dish. Five light dependent resistors were used to sense the sunlight and Two permanent magnet DC motors are used to move the solar dish. A controller software were developed to control the motors using the data sensed by the resistors.

Pavlovic~\cite{Pavlovic2014} presented a procedure to design a square facet concentrator for laboratory-scale research on medium-temperature thermal processes. A parabolic collector made up of individual square mirror panels (facets) were investigated. These facets can deliver up to 13.604 kW radiative power over a 250 mm radius disk (receiver) with average concentrating ratio exceeding 1200.

\section{Rankine Cycle}\label{sec:rc}
\section{Stirling Engine}\label{sec:se}

A large number of studies have been done on Stirling engine analysis. To describe a Stirling engine's behavior precisely is a difficult task due to the various losses and irreversibilities in the engine.
%Recent investigations~\cite{Tlili2006,Li2016} have found that these losses and irreversibilities in the thermodynamic cycle have significant importance in predicting the performance of Stirling engines.
Researchers have done a lot of work to build a precise Stirling engine model. Different models of Stirling engines were developed using empirical~\cite{Senft1998,Costea1999,Prieto2003,Organ2013,Kongtragool2005,Thombare2008}, analytical~\cite{Ohtomo1995,Rogdakis2004,Kongtragool2006,Puech2011,Formosa2010,Shazly2014,Cullen2011,Ahmadi2013,Ahmadi2013b,Tursunbaev2007} and numerical methods~\cite{Urieli1984,Ni2016,Jia2016,Strauss2010,Abbas2014,Araoz2015,Babaelahi2015,Barreto2017,Wu1998,Li2011,Hosseinzade2015}.

Among these methods, numerical methods obtain the most accurate models. Urieli and Berchowitz~\cite{Urieli1984} proposed an adiabatic model of Stirling engine considering some irreversible effects such as non-ideal heat transfer processes and pressure drop effect using numerical methods. The model is known as Simple model. Many researchers developed more accurate models based on the Simple model by using alternative methods or including more loss mechanisms.
Ni et al.~\cite{Ni2016} proposed an improved Simple analytical model which considers the influence mechanism of rotary speed, pressure and working gas in the view of heat/power losses for Stirling engine performance.
Jia et al.~\cite{Jia2016} developed a numerical model of free-piston engine generator. The dynamic equations have been linearized to simplify the model to a one-degree forced vibration system with various damping. The solving time of the proposed fast response model can be significantly reduced comparing to previous numerical models.
Strauss and Dobson~\cite{Strauss2010} proposed an alternative method to calculate the regeneration heat loss and pumping losses, which is more suitable for preliminary engine design and optimisation, known as Simple II model.
Abbas~\cite{Abbas2014} considered the effects of non-ideal regeneration, shuttle loss and heat conduction losses based on Simple model.
Araoz et al.~\cite{Araoz2015} developed a rigorous Stirling engine model with adiabatic working spaces, isothermal heat exchangers. It considers dead volumes, and imperfect regeneration, mechanical pumping losses due to friction, limited heat transfer and thermal losses on the heat exchangers. The model is suitable for different engine configurations ($\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ engines).
Babaelahi and Syyaadi~\cite{Babaelahi2015} proposed a new numerical thermal model based on polytropic expansion/compression processes. Differential equations in the expansion/compression processes were modified to polytropic processes in the new model. New model shows a better performance prediction compared with previous models.

With the development of finite-time thermodynamics, many researchers studied the the finite-time thermodynamic performance of the Stirling engine. This analysis can also be used in the case of irreversible machines further considering the internal irreversibilities of a Stirling engine such as friction, pressure drop and entropy generation~\cite{Barreto2017}.
Wu et al.~\cite{Wu1998} developed a numerical model considering finite-time effect to find out the relationship between the net power output and thermal efficiency of the engine.
Li et al.~\cite{Li2011} developed a mathematical model of a high temperature differential dish-Stirling system with finite-time thermodynamics. Finite-rate heat transfer, regenerative heat losses, conductive thermal bridging losses and finite regeneration processes of the Stirling engine were considered in the model.
Hosseinzade~\cite{Hosseinzade2015} presented a new closed-form thermal model for the thermal simulation of Stirling engines based on the combination of polytropic analysis of expansion/compression processes and the concept of finite speed thermodynamics.
Instead of finite-time method, Ahmadi et al.~\cite{Ahmadi2016b} proposed a finite-speed thermodynamic analysis based on the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system with finite speed and the direct method. The effects of heat source temperature, regenerating effectiveness, volumetric ratio, piston stroke as well as rotational speed are included in the analysis.
Chen et al.~\cite{Chen2007} developed a heat-engine cycle model using finite-time thermodynamics. The model, considered the losses due to heat-resistance, heat leaks and internal irreversibility, is applicable for generalized irreversible universal steady-flow heat-engine cycles.
%Cullen~\cite{Cullen2011} developed a theoretical Stirling engine model by using decoupled engine configuration in which working space swept volume, volume variation, phase angle and dead space ratio are controlled via a black-box electronic controller.

%Thombare~\cite{Thombare2008} presented a detailed review of the past methods and techniques used for engine analysis. Analysis of heat transfer phenomenon in the engine was also included in the review. Formosa~\cite{Formosa2010} developed an analytical model to predict the periodic steady operation under isothermal assumption and simplified heat transfer model. The model was validated using the experimental data of the General Motor GPU-3 Stirling engine prototype. Ohtomo~\cite{Ohtomo1995} proposed a simple graphic vector analysis method for the first-order estimation of the theoretical performance of Stirling engine with Schmidt assumption and, for simplicity, approximates all volume and pressure fluctuations as sinusoidal. Rogdakis~\cite{Rogdakis2004} used a linearization technique of the dynamic balance equations to predict the thermodynamic conditions for stable operation of free piston Stirling engines. Costea~\cite{Costea1999} considered the effects of both internal and external irreversibilities of the cycle. According to his research, the real cycle efficiency is approximately half the ideal cycle efficiency when the engine is operated at the optimum temperature. Araoz~\cite{Araoz2015} investigated the possible causes that limited the performance of a Stirling engine. Based on a second order Stirling engine model developed and validated previously, he implemented an analysis with the integration of thermodynamics, and the thermal and mechanical interactions of kinematic Stirling engines. Wu~\cite{Wu1998} built a model of Stirling engine with heat transfer and imperfect regeneration irreversibilities and derived the relationship between net power output and thermal efficiency by the model. Puech~\cite{Puech2011} and Kongtragool~\cite{Kongtragool2006} considered the influence of dead volume and imperfect regeneration on Stirling engine. An isothermal model was used to analyze the net work and the heat stored in the regenerator during a complete cycle. An analytical expression to estimate the improvement due to the regenerator has been proposed including the combined effects of dead volume and imperfect regeneration.  Formosa~\cite{Formosa2011} developed and validated an analytical thermodynamic model which encompasses the effectiveness and the flaws of the heat exchangers and the regenerator.

On the other side of the researches, multi-objective optimization algorithms were used considering multi-variables to obtain a better performance was paid for attention by numbers of researchers recently~\cite{Ahmadi2016,Li2016b,Patel2016,Luo2016}.
Ahmadi et al.~\cite{Ahmadi2016} performed the thermodynamic analysis of solar dish Stirling engine based on the finite-time thermodynamics. Then the NSGA-II algorithm was applied. Three objectives, thermal efficiency, entransy loss rate and power output, were set as the objectives and three well known decision making methods have been employed in the algorithm.
Li et al.~\cite{Li2016b} developed a multi-objective optimization model of a solar energy powered gamma type Stirling engine using Finite Physical Dimensions Thermodynamics (FPDT) method by multi-objective criteria. Genetic algorithm was used to get the Pareto frontier, and optimum points were obtained using the decision different making methods. Results show that total thermal conductance, hot temperature, stroke and diameter ratios can be improved.
Patel and Savsani~\cite{Patel2016} developed a strategy for multi-objective optimization for Stirling engines using TS-TLBO (tutorial training and self learning inspired teaching-learning-based optimization) algorithm. An application example with eleven decision variables and three objectives are considered.
Luo et al.~\cite{Luo2016} proposed a multiple optimization method that combines multiple optimization algorithms including differential evolution, genetic algorithm and adaptive simulated annealing. The optimization considers five decision variables, including engine frequency, mean effective pressure, temperature of heating source, number of wires in regenerator matrix, and the wire diameter of regenerator for maximum efficiency and output power.

\section{Stirling Engine Array}

\section{Introduction}
%The Stirling engine was invented in 1816, however, its practical use was largely confined to low power domestic applications for over a century due to its small capacity~\cite{Formosa2010}.
With the emphasis on energy and environmental impact, recently gaining attention is focused on Stirling engine for its high efficiency, low maintenance requirement, flexibility on energy sources, no pollution, low explosion risk. Due to its closed cycle, it can use almost any heat source, which makes it compatible with alternative and renewable energy sources.

The Stirling engine is widely used on solar dish system, known as dish-Stirling system. In a traditional dish-Stirling system, each Stirling engines is put on the focus of a parabolic dish to use the heat collected by the dish receiver for power generation. However, solar dish systems are not widely applied yet for its small capacity. Its capacity is mainly constrained by two factors: dish collector size and Stirling engine size. The dish size is limited for the cost and difficulty of production of large mirrors. The Stirling engine size is limited for its low power-to-weight ratio. The tracking feature of dish collector limits the weight of engine on the focal point. Besides, the size of engine is limited for it overlaps part of the collector.

This paper presents new arrangements for dish-Stirling system demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:Dish_SEA} to solve the limitations. Stirling engines are put on the ground as a Stirling engine array (SEA). Heat collected by multiple dish collectors, or other types of collectors, or combination of different types of collectors, even heat from different heat sources is supplied to the SEA. Since the engines are static installations on the ground where space and weight are not at a premium any more, they can reach higher capacities. They can be connected in a different connection type and their performance may be improved compared to the traditional arrangement in which they are put on the focal points of each dish collector separately.

Great attention has focused on the application using parabolic dish to collect heat. Some researchers investigated the impact of various parameters on the optical and thermal performance of the solar dish receivers using Monte Carlo Ray Tracing Method (MCRTM) and/or numerical modeling methods~\cite{Cheng2013,Mao2014,Wang2010,Wang2013,Zhu2015,Sha2016,Daabo2016}. Some researchers considered the applications with different ways to use the collected heat. Loni et al.~\cite{Loni2016} considered a system using parabolic dish for an organic Rankine cycle. In the proposed system, thermal oil is used as the working fluid to transport the collected heat for the organic Rankine cycle. Wang et al.~\cite{Wang2014} proposed an inverse design method for a cavity receiver used in solar dish Brayton system. Craig et al.~\cite{Craig2016} evaluated a parabolic dish tubular receiver used in a dish Brayton cycle. An approach for incorporating a complex geometry like a tubular receiver generated using CFD software into SolTrace was developed. Aichmayer et al.~\cite{Aichmayer2015} presented a hybrid solar micro gas-turbine system integrating volumetric solar dish receiver. Concerning the solar dish receiver integration, both pressurized and atmospheric configurations have been considered. Lovegrove et al.~\cite{Lovegrove2004} presented an idea of using parabolic dish array to provide heat for ammonia based thermochemical energy storage. In this regard, using parabolic dishes to provide heat for SEA is applicable.

A large number of studies have been done on Stirling engine analysis. To describe a Stirling engine's behavior precisely is a difficult task due to the various losses and irreversibilities in the engine.
%Recent investigations~\cite{Tlili2006,Li2016} have found that these losses and irreversibilities in the thermodynamic cycle have significant importance in predicting the performance of Stirling engines.
Researchers have done a lot of work to build a precise Stirling engine model. Different models of Stirling engines were developed using empirical~\cite{Senft1998,Costea1999,Prieto2003,Organ2013,Kongtragool2005,Thombare2008}, analytical~\cite{Ohtomo1995,Rogdakis2004,Kongtragool2006,Puech2011,Formosa2010,Shazly2014,Cullen2011,Ahmadi2013,Ahmadi2013b,Tursunbaev2007} and numerical methods~\cite{Urieli1984,Ni2016,Jia2016,Strauss2010,Abbas2014,Araoz2015,Babaelahi2015,Barreto2017,Wu1998,Li2011,Hosseinzade2015}.

Among these methods, numerical methods obtain the most accurate models. Urieli and Berchowitz~\cite{Urieli1984} proposed an adiabatic model of Stirling engine considering some irreversible effects such as non-ideal heat transfer processes and pressure drop effect using numerical methods. The model is known as Simple model. Many researchers developed more accurate models based on the Simple model by using alternative methods or including more loss mechanisms.
Ni et al.~\cite{Ni2016} proposed an improved Simple analytical model which considers the influence mechanism of rotary speed, pressure and working gas in the view of heat/power losses for Stirling engine performance.
Jia et al.~\cite{Jia2016} developed a numerical model of free-piston engine generator. The dynamic equations have been linearized to simplify the model to a one-degree forced vibration system with various damping. The solving time of the proposed fast response model can be significantly reduced comparing to previous numerical models.
Strauss and Dobson~\cite{Strauss2010} proposed an alternative method to calculate the regeneration heat loss and pumping losses, which is more suitable for preliminary engine design and optimisation, known as Simple II model.
Abbas~\cite{Abbas2014} considered the effects of non-ideal regeneration, shuttle loss and heat conduction losses based on Simple model.
Araoz et al.~\cite{Araoz2015} developed a rigorous Stirling engine model with adiabatic working spaces, isothermal heat exchangers. It considers dead volumes, and imperfect regeneration, mechanical pumping losses due to friction, limited heat transfer and thermal losses on the heat exchangers. The model is suitable for different engine configurations ($\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ engines).
Babaelahi and Syyaadi~\cite{Babaelahi2015} proposed a new numerical thermal model based on polytropic expansion/compression processes. Differential equations in the expansion/compression processes were modified to polytropic processes in the new model. New model shows a better performance prediction compared with previous models.

With the development of finite-time thermodynamics, many researchers studied the the finite-time thermodynamic performance of the Stirling engine. This analysis can also be used in the case of irreversible machines further considering the internal irreversibilities of a Stirling engine such as friction, pressure drop and entropy generation~\cite{Barreto2017}.
Wu et al.~\cite{Wu1998} developed a numerical model considering finite-time effect to find out the relationship between the net power output and thermal efficiency of the engine.
Li et al.~\cite{Li2011} developed a mathematical model of a high temperature differential dish-Stirling system with finite-time thermodynamics. Finite-rate heat transfer, regenerative heat losses, conductive thermal bridging losses and finite regeneration processes of the Stirling engine were considered in the model.
Hosseinzade~\cite{Hosseinzade2015} presented a new closed-form thermal model for the thermal simulation of Stirling engines based on the combination of polytropic analysis of expansion/compression processes and the concept of finite speed thermodynamics.
Instead of finite-time method, Ahmadi et al.~\cite{Ahmadi2016b} proposed a finite-speed thermodynamic analysis based on the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system with finite speed and the direct method. The effects of heat source temperature, regenerating effectiveness, volumetric ratio, piston stroke as well as rotational speed are included in the analysis.
Chen et al.~\cite{Chen2007} developed a heat-engine cycle model using finite-time thermodynamics. The model, considered the losses due to heat-resistance, heat leaks and internal irreversibility, is applicable for generalized irreversible universal steady-flow heat-engine cycles.
%Cullen~\cite{Cullen2011} developed a theoretical Stirling engine model by using decoupled engine configuration in which working space swept volume, volume variation, phase angle and dead space ratio are controlled via a black-box electronic controller.

%Thombare~\cite{Thombare2008} presented a detailed review of the past methods and techniques used for engine analysis. Analysis of heat transfer phenomenon in the engine was also included in the review. Formosa~\cite{Formosa2010} developed an analytical model to predict the periodic steady operation under isothermal assumption and simplified heat transfer model. The model was validated using the experimental data of the General Motor GPU-3 Stirling engine prototype. Ohtomo~\cite{Ohtomo1995} proposed a simple graphic vector analysis method for the first-order estimation of the theoretical performance of Stirling engine with Schmidt assumption and, for simplicity, approximates all volume and pressure fluctuations as sinusoidal. Rogdakis~\cite{Rogdakis2004} used a linearization technique of the dynamic balance equations to predict the thermodynamic conditions for stable operation of free piston Stirling engines. Costea~\cite{Costea1999} considered the effects of both internal and external irreversibilities of the cycle. According to his research, the real cycle efficiency is approximately half the ideal cycle efficiency when the engine is operated at the optimum temperature. Araoz~\cite{Araoz2015} investigated the possible causes that limited the performance of a Stirling engine. Based on a second order Stirling engine model developed and validated previously, he implemented an analysis with the integration of thermodynamics, and the thermal and mechanical interactions of kinematic Stirling engines. Wu~\cite{Wu1998} built a model of Stirling engine with heat transfer and imperfect regeneration irreversibilities and derived the relationship between net power output and thermal efficiency by the model. Puech~\cite{Puech2011} and Kongtragool~\cite{Kongtragool2006} considered the influence of dead volume and imperfect regeneration on Stirling engine. An isothermal model was used to analyze the net work and the heat stored in the regenerator during a complete cycle. An analytical expression to estimate the improvement due to the regenerator has been proposed including the combined effects of dead volume and imperfect regeneration.  Formosa~\cite{Formosa2011} developed and validated an analytical thermodynamic model which encompasses the effectiveness and the flaws of the heat exchangers and the regenerator.

On the other side of the researches, multi-objective optimization algorithms were used considering multi-variables to obtain a better performance was paid for attention by numbers of researchers recently~\cite{Ahmadi2016,Li2016b,Patel2016,Luo2016}.
Ahmadi et al.~\cite{Ahmadi2016} performed the thermodynamic analysis of solar dish Stirling engine based on the finite-time thermodynamics. Then the NSGA-II algorithm was applied. Three objectives, thermal efficiency, entransy loss rate and power output, were set as the objectives and three well known decision making methods have been employed in the algorithm.
Li et al.~\cite{Li2016b} developed a multi-objective optimization model of a solar energy powered gamma type Stirling engine using Finite Physical Dimensions Thermodynamics (FPDT) method by multi-objective criteria. Genetic algorithm was used to get the Pareto frontier, and optimum points were obtained using the decision different making methods. Results show that total thermal conductance, hot temperature, stroke and diameter ratios can be improved.
Patel and Savsani~\cite{Patel2016} developed a strategy for multi-objective optimization for Stirling engines using TS-TLBO (tutorial training and self learning inspired teaching-learning-based optimization) algorithm. An application example with eleven decision variables and three objectives are considered.
Luo et al.~\cite{Luo2016} proposed a multiple optimization method that combines multiple optimization algorithms including differential evolution, genetic algorithm and adaptive simulated annealing. The optimization considers five decision variables, including engine frequency, mean effective pressure, temperature of heating source, number of wires in regenerator matrix, and the wire diameter of regenerator for maximum efficiency and output power.


%There are multiple connection types for Stirling engines in an SEA, and the connection type will change the heating and cooling fluid properties, such as flow rate and temperature, of each Stirling engine in an SEA, which can affect the efficiency of each Stirling engine. So the same Stirling engines with the same heating and cooling fluid may produce different amount of work with different thermal efficiencies depending on their connection types.

However, the literature review indicates that the analysis of arrangements of Stirling engines, classification and performance of the SEA, has not been reported till now. In this regard, this paper investigated the connection types of SEA and its influence on SEA performance. Connection types of SEA were classified and 5 basic connection types were put forward. According to Organ's theory~\cite{Organ1997}, one equivalent analytical Stirling engine model always exists for different types ($\alpha$ type, $\beta$ type and $\gamma$ type) of engines. To find out the influence of connection type of SEA and to avoid falling into the problem of developing specific Stirling engine model, a Stirling engine model based on some assumptions and simplifications was developed. This model was evaluated using experimental data of the General Motor GPU-3 Stirling engine prototype. Imperfect regeneration and some irreversibilities were considered. Heat transfer analysis of Stirling engine with heating and cooling fluids was also included. SEA models of different connection types were built depending on the engine model. Impacts of different parameters on the performance of these models were analyzed.

\section{Connection types of SEA}
For a single Stirling engine, the heat transfer processes between fluids and engine are independent and irrelevant with the direction of the flows, which means the efficiency and power are not affected by the direction of fluids. However, for an SEA, the connection type will affect the temperature profiles through the array and the specific work production, both of which will determine the efficiency and power of the SEA. It is practically significant to investigate the influence of connection type of an SEA on its performance. Then it is essential to classify the SEAs based on the connection type.

5 basic connection types of SEA were summarized according to the direction-irrelevant feature of Stirling engine, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SEA}. Type 1 is parallel flow, Type 2 is serial flows in the same order, Type 3 is serial flows in the reverse order, Type 4 is heating fluid in serial flow and cooling fluid in parallel flow and Type 5 is heating fluid in parallel flow and cooling fluid in serial flow.

	\label{fig:SEA}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

All other connection types are the combination of these 5 basic connection types. For instance, an SEA in Figure~\ref{fig:SEA_eg} is the combination of Type 2 and Type 4.
%Besides, in the tradition form of solar dish system, Stirling engines are put on the focus points of the dish collectors, which can be considered as a particular case of Type 1.

\section{Thermodynamic analysis of Stirling engine}
\subsection{Stirling engine model\label{sec:StirlingEngineModel}}
\subsubsection{Theoretical Stirling cycle}
In a Stirling cycle, there are two isothermal processes that exchange heat with heating and cooling fluids, two isochoric processes that exchange heat with regenerator. In Figure~\ref{fig:StirlingCycle}, the heat absorbed by regenerator in process 4-1 is reused in process 2-3, but only able to heat the working gas from 2 to 3' due to the imperfect regeneration. $e$ is defined as the regenerator effectiveness\cite{Formosa2010,Juhasz2010}, $e=\frac{T_R-T_L}{T_H-T_L}$, where $T_H$ is the temperature in the hot space, $T_L$ is the temperature in the cold space, $T_R$ is the effective working fluid temperature in the regenerator.

	\caption{$T$-$s$ diagram of a Stirling cycle}
	\label{fig:StirlingCycle}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In order to obtain a simplified analytical model, several simplifications were made:

\begin{itemize}
\item The working gas in Stirling engines obeys the idea gas law.
\item No heat loss to the environment for Stirling engines.
\item Overall heat transfer coefficients of the fluids are constant.
\item A symmetrical regenerator behavior is assumed~\cite{Formosa2010,Juhasz2010} so that a simple effectiveness can be obtain by $T_{R}=\frac{T_{H}-T_{L}}{\ln(T_{H}/T_{L})}$.
\end{itemize}

To consider internal irreversibilities in Stirling cycle made by dead volumes, as described in~\cite{Duan2014}, total dead volume $V_D$ is divided into heater dead volume $V_{DH}$, regenerator dead volume $V_{DR}$ and cooler dead volume $V_{DC}$. There exists a factor $K$ to describe the dead volumes under different temperatures. $K$ is relevant with temperatures in the process and regenerator effectiveness.

\subsubsection{Irrevisibilities and losses}

\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item Non-ideal heat transfer effect

Because of non-ideal heater and cooler, the working fluid temperature ($T_{H}$/$T_L$) in these two heat exchangers is less/higher than the wall temperature ($T_{hw}$/$T_{cw}$), respectively. And $T_{H}$ and $T_{L}$ can be corrected by the wall temperatures as follows:

\begin{equation}
	T_H = T_{hw} - \frac{Qs_{se}}{h_hA_{hw}}
	\label{eq:T_H}
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[S]{$hw$}{heater wall}

\begin{equation}
	T_L = T_{cw} + \frac{(Q-W)s_{se}}{h_cA_{cw}}
	\label{eq:T_L}
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[S]{$cw$}{cooler wall}

The heat transfer coefficient can be obtained using the following correlation~\cite{Babaelahi2015}:

\begin{equation}
	h_{h,c} = \frac{\mu c_pf_{Re}}{2D_{h,c}Pr_{h,c}}
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[G]{$\mu$}{dynamic viscosity ($\mathrm{kg\cdot m^{-1}\cdot s^{-1}}$)}

where $f_{Re}$ is a Reynolds friction factor defined as:

\begin{equation}
	f_{Re} = 0.0791{Re_{h,c}}^{0.75}
\end{equation}

$Re_{h,c}$, $Pr_{h,c}$ and $D_{h,c}$ are Reynolds number, Prandtl number and hydraulic diameter of the heater/cooler exchanger.

\item Effect of pressure drop

Pressure drops in the heat exchangers cause power losses of the Stirling engine. The pressure drops can be obtained by~\cite{Urieli1984}:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta p = -\frac{2f_{Re}\mu u V}{d^2A}
\end{equation}
\nomenclature{$p$}{pressure (Pa)}

where $u$ is the working gas speed, $V$ is volume, $A$ is flow cross-section area.

The net power loss of the Stirling engine due to pressure drop of the heat exchangers can be evaluated by:

\begin{equation}
	W_{pd} = \oint\underset{i = E,C}{\sum}(\Delta p_{i}\frac{dV_i}{d\theta})d\theta
\end{equation}

\item Effect of finite speed of piston and mechanical friction

Due to the finite speed of piston, the pressure on the piston surface is different from the pressure of expansion and compression spaces. It has been demonstrated that the pressure on the piston surface in the expansion process is less than the mean pressure in the expansion space. Similarly, the pressure on the piston surface in the compression process is greater than the mean pressure in the compression space. This means the output work is less than the theoretical value. Besides, The output work also reduces due to mechanical friction. The output work loss due to finite speed of piston and mechanical friction can be obtained as follows~\cite{Babaelahi2015}:

\begin{equation}
	W_{fs} = \oint p(\pm\frac{au_p}{c}\pm\frac{\Delta p_f}{p})dV
\end{equation}

where the sign (+) is used in the compression space, and the sign (-) is used in the expansion space. $p$ is the mean pressure in the compression/expansion space, $u_p$ is velocity of the piston, $c$ is the average speed of molecules and $\Delta p_f$ is the pressure loss due to mechanical friction. $\Delta p_f$, $a$ and $c$ can be obtained by~\cite{Heywood1988}:

\begin{equation}
	\Delta p_f = 0.97+0.009s_{se}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	a = \sqrt{3k}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	c = \sqrt{3RT}
\end{equation}

\item Energy losses due to internal conduction

The temperature differs from the heater and cooler, heat losses from heater to cooler exists due to internal conduction through the walls of regenerator.~\cite{Strauss2010} The internal conduction loss in a cycle can be obtained by follows:

\begin{equation}
	Q_{id} = \frac{k_rA_r}{L_rs_{se}}(T_{hw} - T_{cw})
\end{equation}

where, $k_r$, $A_r$ and $L_r$ denote the regenerator matrix conductivity, regenerator length, and regenerator conductive area respectively.
\nomenclature[S]{$r$}{regenerator}

\item Energy losses due to shuttle conduction

The displacer shuttles between the expansion and compression space. It absorbs heat during the hot end of its stroke and releases it during the cold end of its stroke. This heat loss can be estimated as~\cite{Timoumi2008}:

\begin{equation}
	Q_{sc} = 0.4\frac{Z^2k_pD_p}{JL_ds_{se}}(T_{H} - T_{L})
\end{equation}

where, $Z$, $k_p$, $D_p$, $J$ and $L_d$ denote the displacer stroke, piston thermal conductivity, displacer diameter, gap between the displacer and the cylinder, and length of the displacer respectively.
\nomenclature{$Z$}{displacer stroke (m)}
\nomenclature{$J$}{annular gap cylinder displacer (m)}
\nomenclature[S]{$p$}{piston}

\end{enumerate}

So, in a Stirling engine, the total absorbed heat in a cycle

\begin{equation}
	Q = Q_{th} + Q_{id} + Q_{sc}
\end{equation}

the output work

\begin{equation}
	W = W_{th} - W_{pd} - W_{fs}
\end{equation}

Power of the Stirling engine

\begin{equation}
	P = Ws_{se}
	\label{Eq:P}
\end{equation}

Efficiency of the Stirling engine

\begin{equation}
	\eta = W/Q
	\label{Eq:eta}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Model validation}

Evaluation of the developed thermal model was performed by considering the GPU-3 Stirling engine as a case study. Design specifications of the GPU-3 Stirling engine are indicated in Table~\ref{tab:GPU3parameters}. The thermal efficiency and power of the proposed Stirling engine model was compared with previous thermal models and experimental data as shown in Table~\ref{tab:EfficiencyComparison} and Table~\ref{tab:PowerComparison}.

It can be found that the proposed model has much better agreement with the experimental results than previous thermal models at various rotation speeds and mean effective pressures. It is required to mention that in all thermal models both power $W$ and input heat $Q$ were determined by the thermal process of heat transfer between the wall and working gas. In the proposed model, $W$ and $Q$ are obtained by Equation~\ref{eq:T_H} and~\ref{eq:T_L}. Therefore all the three parameters $W$, $Q$ and $\eta$ are determined by the thermal model and input parameters to the model. These input parameters includes heater, cooler, mean effective pressure, type of working gas and geometrical specification of the engine.

Table~\ref{tab:EfficiencyComparison} and~\ref{tab:PowerComparison} indicate that when mean effective pressure of the engine increases from $2.76\,\mathrm{MPa}$ to $6.90\,\mathrm{MPa}$, best performance (efficiency and power) prediction of the proposed model exists. When rotation speed increases from $16.67\,\mathrm{Hz}$ to $58.33\,\mathrm{Hz}$, error in prediction of performance of the proposed model increases. The proposed model may have the best performance prediction at a low rotation speed, with mean effective pressure between $4.14\,\mathrm{MPa}$ and $5.52\,\mathrm{MPa}$.

However, there is still some discrepancy between the the simulation results of proposed model and the experimental data. In the future researches, more accurate models of Stirling engine may be developed by considering other irreversibilities such as heat loss to the environment, gas spring hysteresis, and etc. It is worth pointing that there are more accurate Stirling engine models. For example, polytropic simulation models of Stirling engine show higher accuracy than our proposed model~\cite{Hosseinzade2015, Babaelahi2015}. However, the model needs more costly calculations and the polytropic indexes are engine-specific.

\subsection{Heat transfer between the engine and the fluids}

For a Stirling engine thermal process, the wall temperatures of the heater and cooler are considered to be uniform and constant. The heat transferred between the wall and the fluids is
%with heating and cooling fluids, the heat exchange processes are considered to be isothermal processes.

%. Then $\eta$ and $P$ can be obtained by Equation~\ref{Eq:eta} and~\ref{Eq:P}. This means the performance of a given Stirling engine can be inquired by the input/output parameters of heating/cooling fluids.

\section{Modeling of the SEAs}

To determine the performance of an SEA, models of all the Stirling engines need to be built depending on their thermodynamic characteristic. Stirling engines are chosen to have the same parameters including the same speed $s_{se}$. This is especially practical when using SEA for power generation, where the output power frequency should be constant. The speed of Stirling engine can be calibrated by speed controller system~\cite{Hooshang2016}. To eliminate interference of other factors, heating and cooling fluids are chosen to have same parameters for different connection types of SEAs. To clearly find out the performance differences of different SEAs, large temperature differences of the heating/cooling fluids after heat exchange with the engines are preferred. Air is chosen as the cooling fluid instead of commonly used water to avoid small temperature rise and evaporation after the cooling process. Chosen parameters of Stirling engines and heating/cooling fluids in SEAs are shown in Table~\ref{tab:parameters}.

In an SEA, there are 2 flows as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SEA}. In a serial flow, each engine's mass flow rate is $q_m$, and from the flow's direction, for $2\leqslant{}x\leqslant{}n_{se}$, $T_{i,x} = T_{o,x-1}$. In a parallel flow, each engine's mass flow is $q_m/n_{se}$, for $2\leqslant{}x\leqslant{}n_{se}$, $T_{i,x} = T_{i,h}$.

%According to the equations

%(Equation~\ref{Eq:T_h}-\ref{Eq:T_parallel})
%, there are $6n_{se} - 2$ equations for $6n_{se}$ parameters for $n_{se}$ engines. Other parameters of an SEA can be calculated by the given inlet temperature of the heating and cooling fluids. The efficiency and power of each engine can be obtained from Equation~\ref{Eq:eta},~\ref{Eq:P}. The total efficiency and power of SEA can be obtained by powers of engines and outlet properties of the fluids.

MATLAB was used as the programming tool to build the model of SEAs, and CoolProp was used to provide fluid properties for MATLAB program. 5 basic SEA models composed of the aforementioned Stirling engines and fluids were built. To compare SEA connection types under various conditions, several parameters are investigated to find out their effects on SEA performance.

Figure~\ref{fig:Flowchart} shows the solution algorithm of the SEA model. As it is shown, known inlet parameters of the fluids, the performance of a Stirling engine can be obtained from flowchart (a) according to the equations derived; similarly, known inlet parameters of heating fluid and outlet parameters of cooling fluid, the performance of a Stirling engine can be obtained from flowchart (b). Flowchart (c) shows the algorithm to solve the SEA model iteratively depending on different connection types. The levenberg-marquardt algorithm is applied to numerically solve the non-linear equations in the flowcharts.

\section{Result Analysis}
%The objective of this study is to investigate SEA performance difference of different connection types. Therefore,

SEA models with specified parameters in Table~\ref{tab:parameters} were built and calculated. Results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:result}, it can be found that under specified parameters Type 3 has the highest efficiency and output power, while Type 1 has the lowest efficiency and output power.

\subsection{Effectes of $T_{i,h}$}
According to Carnot cycle efficiency formula, the temperature of heating fluid determines the efficiency of Stirling engine array. For a Stirling engine, lower temperature heating fluid leads to a lower efficiency. The efficiency and output power may drop to 0 due to its insufficient heating fluid temperature to drive the engine.

\noindent \begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width = 0.7\columnwidth]{./fig/T_ih}
	\caption{Influence of $T_{i,h}$ on efficiency and power of SEA}
	\label{fig:Ti_h}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Curves of performance of SEAs and $T_{i,h}$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Ti_h}.
As it is shown, with the increase of $T_{i,h}$, both $\eta$ and $P$ increase for all SEAs. For some types of SEA, when $T_{i,h}$ is lower than a critical temperature, some of the engines in the SEA will not work and there will be turning points on the $\eta-T_{i,h}$, $P-T_{i,h}$ curves. E.g. for SEA of Type 1, when $T_{i,h}$ is lower 820\,K, all the engines stop working, turning points at 820\,K can be found on the $\eta-T_{i,h}$, $P-T_{i,h}$ curves in Figure~\ref{fig:Ti_h}.
%Multiple turning points on one curve means different engines in the SEA stop working from different temperatures.

From curves in Figure~\ref{fig:Ti_h}, it can be concluded that Type 2 and Type 3 have the best performance, and Type 2 has the best adaptability for lower $T_{i,h}$. All engines in Type 2 begin to work at 730\,K.

\subsection{Effects of $q_mc_p$}

According to Equation~\ref{Eq:q_h},~\ref{Eq:q_c}, $q_mc_p$ (both $q_{m,h}c_{p,h}$ and $q_{m,c}c_{p,c}$) will affect the heat transfer process, which is one of the vital factor for the performance of SEA.


\noindent \begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width = 0.7\columnwidth]{./fig/qm_hcp_h}
	\caption{Influence of $q_{m,h}c_{p,h}$ on efficiency and power of SEA}
	\label{fig:qm_hcp_h}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Curves of performance of SEAs and $q_{m,h}c_{p,h}$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:qm_hcp_h}.
%For a connection type of SEA, $q_{m,h}c_{p,h}$ has little effect on the performance of the SEA if it is big enough to drive the engines. This means increase the mass flow rate of heating fluid will not increase the efficiency and power of SEA significantly.
For a large $q_{m,h}c_{p,h}$ ($>$ 800 W/K), Type 2 , Type 3 and Type 5 have similar performance, which can be interpreted as the cooling fluid has the same properties for the two types of SEAs, and for a large $q_{m,h}c_{p,h}$, the heating fluid has similar effect after diverged. Similar performance of Type 1 and Type 4 can be also interpreted for the same reason.

Curves of performance of SEAs and $q_{m,c}c_{p,c}$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:qm_ccp_c}. For a connection type of SEA, the performance improves with the increase of $q_{m,c}c_{p,c}$. For a large $q_{m,c}c_{p,c}$ ($>$ 800 W/K), Type 2 and Type 3 have similar performance, which means the flow order doesn't affect the performance of SEA with a large $q_{m,c}c_{p,c}$. There exists an intersection point (at 830 W/K) of curves of Type 4 and Type 5. For a larger $q_{m,c}c_{p,c}$, Type 4 has a better performance, and vice versa. This can be interpreted that larger $q_{m,c}c_{p,c}$ weaken the drawback of larger temperature rise of parallel flow, while for the heating fluid, temperature drop of serial flow is smaller than parallel flow.

\subsection{Effects of $n_{se}$}

By varying the number of engines in SEA, the performance levels changed accordingly. $n_{se}$ may affect both the flow rates and temperatures of fluids of each engine. Figure~\ref{fig:n_se} shows curves of performance of SEAs with different $n_{se}$. As it is shown, with an increase of $n_{se}$ leads to a reduction of $\eta$ for all SEAs due to smaller heating and cooling average temperature difference for more engines. For some types of SEA, when $n_{se}$ is larger than a critical value, some of the engines in the SEA will not work and the curves will dive. E.g. for SEA of Type 1, when $n_{se}$ is larger than 9, all the engines stop working, turning points at 9 can be found on the $\eta-n_{se}$, $P-n_{se}$ curves in Figure~\ref{fig:n_se}.

\end{figure}

For Type 1, when $n_{se} \geqslant 10$, all engines stop working for given heating and cooling fluids due to small $q_mc_p$. For Type 2 and Type 3, every engine in the SEAs works, by increasing $n_{se}$, $\eta$ reduces due to smaller temperature difference of the fluids, and $P$ increases due to more operating engines. For Type 4, by checking results, it can be found that when $n_{se} = 13$,  the last engine doesn't work; when $n_{se} = 14$, only the first 10 engines will work; when $n_{se} = 15$, the working engine number drops to 9. For Type 5, by checking results, it can be found that when $n_{se} = 12$, the last 2 engines stop working; when $n_{se} = 13$, only the first 8 engines will work; when $n_{se} = 14$, the working engine number drops to 6; when $n_{se} = 15$, the working engine number drops to 4.

\section{Conclusion}

Connection type may change the flow rates and temperatures of the fluids, as a result the performance of the SEA will be different depending on the connection schemes. In order to compare performance of SEAs with different connections, five basic connection types of SEA were summed up according to flow type and flow order.

Analytical Stirling engine model was created to develop the SEA models for the investigation of influence of connection types. Imperfect regeneration and cycle irreversibility of Stirling engine cycle and heat exchange process between fluids and engine were considered in the model. The model was evaluated by considering the prototype GPU-3 Stirling engine as a case study. Result shows that the proposed model predicted the performance with higher accuracy than the previous models. Models of SEAs were developed to calculated the performance under different parameters to find out impacts of $T_{i,h}$, $q_{m,h}c_{p,h}$, $q_{m,c}c_{p,c}$ and $n_{se}$ on different connection types.

It was found that, as expected, decrease $T_{i,h}$ and $q_{m}c_{p}$ will weaken the performance of SEA of all connection types. However, for some connection types, there exists a critical temperature below which some engines stop working. This needs to be considered for SEA connection type selection, especially when $T_{i,h}$ is low. For given $T_{i,h}$, $T_{i,c}$ and $q_mc_p$, Type 2 has the best performance and adaptability.

From Figure~\ref{fig:Ti_h}-\ref{fig:n_se}, it can be found that Type 2 and Type 3 have the best performance, while Type 1 has the worst performance. Type 2 and Type 3 have similar performance under different parameters ($T_{i,h}$, $T_{i,c}$ and $q_mc_p$), which means the flow order has little influence on the performance of an SEA.

For a certain connection type, increase $n_{se}$ will reduce the efficiency of SEA. For some connection types, increase $n_{se}$ will reduce the output power $P$ due to inoperative engines and smaller output power engines. Thus it is important to choose the number of engines for some connection types of SEA.

As a conclusion, SEA of serial flows has the best performance and adaptability under different parameters. Given heating and cooling fluids, using serial flow is the best choice for the connection type of an SEA. %This means the new arrangement of dish-Stirling system in Figure~\ref{fig:Dish_SEA} may have better performance than the traditional arrangement, which can be considered as a particular case of Type 1.

It is important to note that, in the future researches, the experiments of influence of connection type on SEA's performance can be carried out to verify the conclusions in this paper.
