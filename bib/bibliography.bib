  Abstract                 = {Solar Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTCs) are currently used for the production of electricity and applications with relatively higher temperatures. A heat transfer fluid circulates through a metal tube (receiver) with an external selective surface that absorbs solar radiation reflected from the mirror surfaces of the PTC. In order to reduce the heat losses, the receiver is covered by an envelope and the enclosure is usually kept under vacuum pressure. The heat transfer and optical analysis of the \{PTC\} is essential to optimize and understand its performance under different operating conditions. In this paper a detailed one dimensional numerical heat transfer analysis of a \{PTC\} is performed. The receiver and envelope were divided into several segments and mass and energy balance were applied in each segment. Improvements either in the heat transfer correlations or radiative heat transfer analysis are presented as well. The partial differential equations were discretized and the nonlinear algebraic equations were solved simultaneously. Finally, to validate the numerical results, the model was compared with experimental data obtained from Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) and other one dimensional heat transfer models. Our results showed a better agreement with experimental data compared to other models. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The influences of some parameters on the performance of parabolic trough solar receiver are investigated in the present work. When the mass flow rate of working fluid, ambient temperature and solar incident angle increase, the heat losses of solar receiver decrease. The exergy losses of solar receiver increase as the inlet temperature of working fluid, wind velocity, and the inner diameter of glass cover increase. The convective heat loss of glass cover predominates in the heat losses of solar receiver based on thermal efficiency, but the exergy lost from absorber ends takes the largest proportion. The optical heat loss of solar collector is far more than the heat losses of solar receiver, especially in the larger solar incident angle. There exists an optimal mass flow rate of working fluid for exergy efficiency, and the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency have opposite changing tendencies under some conditions. Therefore, the selection of evaluation criteria is crucial to the performance optimization of solar collector system. This study is of great significance to guide the design and optimization of parabolic trough receivers. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper presents an exergy analysis to study the effects of operational and environmental parameters on the performance of Parabolic Trough Collectors. The exergy analysis is based on a previous heat transfer model published by the authors. The main parameters considered for the analysis are: inlet temperature and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid, wind speed, pressure or vacuum in annulus and solar irradiance. The results showed that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid, solar irradiance, and vacuum in annulus have a significant effect on the thermal and exergetic performance, but the effect of wind speed and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid is negligible. It was obtained that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid cannot be optimized to achieve simultaneously maximum thermal and exergetic efficiency because they exhibit opposite trends. Finally, it was found that the highest exergy destruction is due to the heat transfer between the sun and the absorber while for exergy losses is due to optical error. },

  Abstract                 = {Parabolic trough solar technology is the most proven and lowest cost large-scale solar power technology available today, primarily because of the nine large commercial-scale solar power plants that are operating in the California Mojave Desert.

More than 2,000,000鈥塵2 of parabolic trough collector technology has been operating daily for up to 18 years, and as the year 2001 ended, these plants had accumulated 127 years of operational experience. The Luz collector technology has demonstrated its ability to operate in a commercial power plant environment like no other solar technology in the world. Although no new plants have been built since 1990, significant advancements in collector and plant design have been made possible by the efforts of the SEGS plants operators, the parabolic trough industry, and solar research laboratories around the world. This paper reviews the current state of the art of parabolic trough solar power technology and describes the R&amp;D efforts that are in progress to enhance this technology.

To overcome the shortcoming of single-parameter optimization, a multi-parameter optimization of parabolic trough solar receiver is employed based on genetic algorithm in the present work. When the thermal efficiency is taken as the objective function, the heat obtained by working fluid increases while the average temperature of working fluid and wall temperatures of solar receiver decrease. The average temperature of working fluid and the wall temperatures of solar receiver increase while the heat obtained by working fluid decreases generally by taking the exergy efficiency as an objective function. Assuming that the solar radiation intensity remains constant, the exergy obtained by working fluid increases by taking exergy efficiency as the objective function, which comes at the expense of heat losses of solar receiver. },

  Abstract = {Abstract Parabolic trough systems are the most used concentrated solar power technology. The operating performance and optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collectors (PTCs) are different in different regions and different seasons. To determine the optimum design and operation of the parabolic trough solar collector throughout the year, an accurate estimation of the daily performance is needed. In this study, a mathematical model for the optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collector was established and three typical regions of solar thermal utilization in China were selected. The performance characteristics of cosine effect, shadowing effect, end loss effect, and optical efficiency were calculated and simulated during a whole year in these three areas by using the mathematical model. The simulation results show that the optical efficiency of PTCs changes from 0.4 to 0.8 in a whole year. The highest optical efficiency of PTCs is in June and the lowest is in December. The optical efficiency of PTCs is mainly influenced by the solar incidence angle. The model is validated by comparing the test results in parabolic trough power plant, with relative error range of 1% to about 5%.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this paper, detailed exergy analysis of selected thermal power systems driven by parabolic trough solar collectors (PTSCs) is presented. The power is produced using either a steam Rankine cycle (SRC) or a combined cycle, in which the \{SRC\} is the topping cycle and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is the bottoming cycle. Seven refrigerants for the \{ORC\} were examined: R134a, R152a, R290, R407c, R600, R600a, and ammonia. Key exergetic parameters were examined: exergetic efficiency, exergy destruction rate, fuel depletion ratio, irreversibility ratio, and improvement potential. For all the cases considered it was revealed that as the solar irradiation increases, the exergetic efficiency increases. Among the combined cycles examined, the \{R134a\} combined cycle demonstrates the best exergetic performance with a maximum exergetic efficiency of 26% followed by the \{R152a\} combined cycle with an exergetic efficiency of 25%. Alternatively, the \{R600a\} combined cycle has the lowest exergetic efficiency, 20-21%. This study reveals that the main source of exergy destruction is the solar collector where more than 50% of inlet exergy is destructed, or in other words more than 70% of the total destructed exergy. In addition, more than 13% of the inlet exergy is destructed in the evaporator which is equivalent to around 19% of the destructed exergy. Finally, this study reveals that there is an exergetic improvement potential of 75% in the systems considered. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Parabolic trough solar collector is the most proven industry-scale solar generation technology today available. The thermal performance of such devices is of major interest for optimising the solar field output and increase the efficiency of power plants. In this paper, a detailed numerical heat transfer model based on the finite volume method for these equipment is presented. In the model, the different elements of the receiver are discretised into several segments in both axial and azimuthal directions and energy balances are applied for each control volume. An optical model is also developed for calculating the non-uniform solar flux distribution around the receiver. This model is based on finite volume method and ray trace techniques and takes into account the finite size of the Sun. The solar heat flux is determined as a pre-processing task and coupled to the energy balance model as a boundary condition for the outer surface of the receiver. The set of algebraic equations are solved simultaneously using direct solvers. The model is thoroughly validated with results from the literature. First, the optical model is compared with known analytical solutions. After that, the performance of the overall model is tested against experimental measurements from Sandia National Laboratories and other un-irradiated receivers experiments. In all cases, results obtained shown a good agreement with experimental and analytical results. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Recently, with decreasing oil resources and environmental issues associated to use of fossil fuels, solar thermal power plants have attracted much attention among researches mainly due to zero emission and huge fuel savings they bring about. In this study, a small scale parabolic Trough collector and a thermal storage tank along with an auxiliary heater are coupled to a Kalina cycle to study the performance of the system throughout the year, both thermodynamically and economically. To examine the effect of solar collectors in the system, the model is compared to a fuel driven Kalina cycle. Results show that in 5 months of the year, the solar fraction is more than 50%. The exergy analysis reveals that the main source of destructions are solar collectors (more than 50% of total) and vapor generator. The solar collectors and vapor generator have an improvement potential of 69% and 65%, respectively. The Kalina cycle is responsible for a minor portion of total exergy destruction, thus more investment should be put on solar collectors. Economic analysis shows that, under design conditions, solar Kalina cycle has a levelized cost of electricity of 0.4274 $/kW h which is higher compared to that of fuel driven cycle with 0.3113 $/kW h. On the other hand, the solar system has a yearly fuel saving of almost 40,000 kg/year (natural gas) which is half of fuel driven cycle and can save more than 100 tons of carbon dioxide. Also, solar fraction and daily mean sun to electricity exergy efficiency of 67.71% and 5.24% are obtained, respectively, for July. Also, the thermal storage tank has a vital role on maintaining the stable working condition of Kalina cycle. To find the effect of key parameters on the performance and economic of solar system, a parametric study has been done. The results show that ammonia mass fraction variation has the most effect on exergy efficiency, solar fraction and levelized cost of electricity. This paper provides the reader to examine the performance of a small scale solar plant from exergetic view point and to estimate the overall costs associated to the system. },
