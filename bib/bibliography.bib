  Abstract                 = {Solar Parabolic Trough Collectors (PTCs) are currently used for the production of electricity and applications with relatively higher temperatures. A heat transfer fluid circulates through a metal tube (receiver) with an external selective surface that absorbs solar radiation reflected from the mirror surfaces of the PTC. In order to reduce the heat losses, the receiver is covered by an envelope and the enclosure is usually kept under vacuum pressure. The heat transfer and optical analysis of the \{PTC\} is essential to optimize and understand its performance under different operating conditions. In this paper a detailed one dimensional numerical heat transfer analysis of a \{PTC\} is performed. The receiver and envelope were divided into several segments and mass and energy balance were applied in each segment. Improvements either in the heat transfer correlations or radiative heat transfer analysis are presented as well. The partial differential equations were discretized and the nonlinear algebraic equations were solved simultaneously. Finally, to validate the numerical results, the model was compared with experimental data obtained from Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) and other one dimensional heat transfer models. Our results showed a better agreement with experimental data compared to other models. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The influences of some parameters on the performance of parabolic trough solar receiver are investigated in the present work. When the mass flow rate of working fluid, ambient temperature and solar incident angle increase, the heat losses of solar receiver decrease. The exergy losses of solar receiver increase as the inlet temperature of working fluid, wind velocity, and the inner diameter of glass cover increase. The convective heat loss of glass cover predominates in the heat losses of solar receiver based on thermal efficiency, but the exergy lost from absorber ends takes the largest proportion. The optical heat loss of solar collector is far more than the heat losses of solar receiver, especially in the larger solar incident angle. There exists an optimal mass flow rate of working fluid for exergy efficiency, and the thermal efficiency and exergy efficiency have opposite changing tendencies under some conditions. Therefore, the selection of evaluation criteria is crucial to the performance optimization of solar collector system. This study is of great significance to guide the design and optimization of parabolic trough receivers. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper presents an exergy analysis to study the effects of operational and environmental parameters on the performance of Parabolic Trough Collectors. The exergy analysis is based on a previous heat transfer model published by the authors. The main parameters considered for the analysis are: inlet temperature and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid, wind speed, pressure or vacuum in annulus and solar irradiance. The results showed that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid, solar irradiance, and vacuum in annulus have a significant effect on the thermal and exergetic performance, but the effect of wind speed and mass flow rate of heat transfer fluid is negligible. It was obtained that inlet temperature of heat transfer fluid cannot be optimized to achieve simultaneously maximum thermal and exergetic efficiency because they exhibit opposite trends. Finally, it was found that the highest exergy destruction is due to the heat transfer between the sun and the absorber while for exergy losses is due to optical error. },

The Luz collector technology has demonstrated its ability to operate in a commercial power plant environment like no other solar technology in the world. Although no new plants have been built since 1990, significant advancements in collector and plant design have been made possible by the efforts of the SEGS plants operators, the parabolic trough industry, and solar research laboratories around the world.

To overcome the shortcoming of single-parameter optimization, a multi-parameter optimization of parabolic trough solar receiver is employed based on genetic algorithm in the present work. When the thermal efficiency is taken as the objective function, the heat obtained by working fluid increases while the average temperature of working fluid and wall temperatures of solar receiver decrease. The average temperature of working fluid and the wall temperatures of solar receiver increase while the heat obtained by working fluid decreases generally by taking the exergy efficiency as an objective function. Assuming that the solar radiation intensity remains constant, the exergy obtained by working fluid increases by taking exergy efficiency as the objective function, which comes at the expense of heat losses of solar receiver. },

  Abstract = {Abstract Parabolic trough systems are the most used concentrated solar power technology. The operating performance and optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collectors (PTCs) are different in different regions and different seasons. To determine the optimum design and operation of the parabolic trough solar collector throughout the year, an accurate estimation of the daily performance is needed. In this study, a mathematical model for the optical efficiency of the parabolic trough solar collector was established and three typical regions of solar thermal utilization in China were selected. The performance characteristics of cosine effect, shadowing effect, end loss effect, and optical efficiency were calculated and simulated during a whole year in these three areas by using the mathematical model. The simulation results show that the optical efficiency of PTCs changes from 0.4 to 0.8 in a whole year. The highest optical efficiency of PTCs is in June and the lowest is in December. The optical efficiency of PTCs is mainly influenced by the solar incidence angle. The model is validated by comparing the test results in parabolic trough power plant, with relative error range of 1% to about 5%.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this paper, detailed exergy analysis of selected thermal power systems driven by parabolic trough solar collectors (PTSCs) is presented. The power is produced using either a steam Rankine cycle (SRC) or a combined cycle, in which the \{SRC\} is the topping cycle and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is the bottoming cycle. Seven refrigerants for the \{ORC\} were examined: R134a, R152a, R290, R407c, R600, R600a, and ammonia. Key exergetic parameters were examined: exergetic efficiency, exergy destruction rate, fuel depletion ratio, irreversibility ratio, and improvement potential. For all the cases considered it was revealed that as the solar irradiation increases, the exergetic efficiency increases. Among the combined cycles examined, the \{R134a\} combined cycle demonstrates the best exergetic performance with a maximum exergetic efficiency of 26% followed by the \{R152a\} combined cycle with an exergetic efficiency of 25%. Alternatively, the \{R600a\} combined cycle has the lowest exergetic efficiency, 20-21%. This study reveals that the main source of exergy destruction is the solar collector where more than 50% of inlet exergy is destructed, or in other words more than 70% of the total destructed exergy. In addition, more than 13% of the inlet exergy is destructed in the evaporator which is equivalent to around 19% of the destructed exergy. Finally, this study reveals that there is an exergetic improvement potential of 75% in the systems considered. },

The thermal performance of such devices is of major interest for optimising the solar field output and increase the efficiency of power plants. In this paper, a detailed numerical heat transfer model based on the finite volume method for these equipment is presented. In the model, the different elements of the receiver are discretised into several segments in both axial and azimuthal directions and energy balances are applied for each control volume. An optical model is also developed for calculating the non-uniform solar flux distribution around the receiver. This model is based on finite volume method and ray trace techniques and takes into account the finite size of the Sun. The solar heat flux is determined as a pre-processing task and coupled to the energy balance model as a boundary condition for the outer surface of the receiver. The set of algebraic equations are solved simultaneously using direct solvers. The model is thoroughly validated with results from the literature. First, the optical model is compared with known analytical solutions. After that, the performance of the overall model is tested against experimental measurements from Sandia National Laboratories and other un-irradiated receivers experiments. In all cases, results obtained shown a good agreement with experimental and analytical results. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Recently, with decreasing oil resources and environmental issues associated to use of fossil fuels, solar thermal power plants have attracted much attention among researches mainly due to zero emission and huge fuel savings they bring about. In this study, a small scale parabolic Trough collector and a thermal storage tank along with an auxiliary heater are coupled to a Kalina cycle to study the performance of the system throughout the year, both thermodynamically and economically. To examine the effect of solar collectors in the system, the model is compared to a fuel driven Kalina cycle. Results show that in 5 months of the year, the solar fraction is more than 50%. The exergy analysis reveals that the main source of destructions are solar collectors (more than 50% of total) and vapor generator. The solar collectors and vapor generator have an improvement potential of 69% and 65%, respectively. The Kalina cycle is responsible for a minor portion of total exergy destruction, thus more investment should be put on solar collectors. Economic analysis shows that, under design conditions, solar Kalina cycle has a levelized cost of electricity of 0.4274 $/kW h which is higher compared to that of fuel driven cycle with 0.3113 $/kW h. On the other hand, the solar system has a yearly fuel saving of almost 40,000 kg/year (natural gas) which is half of fuel driven cycle and can save more than 100 tons of carbon dioxide. Also, solar fraction and daily mean sun to electricity exergy efficiency of 67.71% and 5.24% are obtained, respectively, for July. Also, the thermal storage tank has a vital role on maintaining the stable working condition of Kalina cycle. To find the effect of key parameters on the performance and economic of solar system, a parametric study has been done. The results show that ammonia mass fraction variation has the most effect on exergy efficiency, solar fraction and levelized cost of electricity. This paper provides the reader to examine the performance of a small scale solar plant from exergetic view point and to estimate the overall costs associated to the system. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Direct steam generation is a potential approach to further reduce the levelized electricity cost of solar trough. Dynamic modeling of the collector loop is essential for operation and control of direct steam generation solar trough. However, the dynamic behavior of fluid based on direct steam generation is complex because of the two-phase flow in the pipeline. In this work, a nonlinear distribution parameter model has been developed to model the dynamic behaviors of direct steam generation parabolic trough collector loops under either full or partial solar irradiance disturbance. Compared with available dynamic model, the proposed model possesses two advantages: (1) real-time local values of heat transfer coefficient and friction resistance coefficient, and (2) considering of the complete loop of collectors, including subcooled water region, two-phase flow region and superheated steam region. The proposed model has shown superior performance, particularly in case of sensitivity study of fluid parameters when the pipe is partially shaded. The proposed model has been validated using experimental data from Solar Thermal Energy Laboratory of University of New South Wales, with an outlet fluid temperature relative error of only 1.91%. The validation results show that: (1) The proposed model successfully outperforms two reference models in predicting the behavior of direct steam generation solar trough. (2) The model theoretically predicts that, during solar irradiance disturbance, the discontinuities of fluid physical property parameters and the moving back and forth of two-phase flow ending location are the reasons that result in the high-frequency chattering of outlet fluid flow. (3) The model validates that the solar irradiance disturbance at subcooled water region would generates larger fluctuation of fluid parameters than two-phase flow region or superheated steam region. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A tubular cavity-receiver that uses air as the heat transfer fluid is evaluated numerically using a validated heat transfer model. The receiver is designed for use on a large-span (9 m net concentrator aperture width) solar parabolic trough concentrator. Through the combination of a parabolic primary concentrator with a nonimaging secondary concentrator, the collector reaches a solar concentration ratio of 97.5. Four different receiver configurations are considered, with smooth or V-corrugated absorber tube and single- or double-glazed aperture window. The collector's performance is characterized by its optical efficiency and heat loss. The optical efficiency is determined with the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. Radiative heat exchange inside the receiver is calculated with the net radiation method. The 2D steady-state energy equation, which couples conductive, convective, and radiative heat transfer, is solved for the solid domains of the receiver cross-section, using finite-volume techniques. Simulations for Sevilla/Spain at the summer solstice at solar noon (direct normal solar irradiance: 847 W$\cdot$m$^{-2}$, solar incidence angle: 13.9$^\circ$) yield collector efficiencies between 60\% and 65\% at a heat transfer fluid temperature of 125$^\circ{}C$ and between 37\% and 42\% at 500$^\circ{}C$, depending on the receiver configuration. The optical losses amount to more than 30\% of the incident solar radiation and constitute the largest source of energy loss. For a 200 m long collector module operated between 300 and 500$^\circ{}C$, the isentropic pumping power required to pump the \{HTF\} through the receiver is between 11 and 17 kW. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An entirely novel solar receiver design for solar trough concentrators is proposed using air as heat transfer fluid at operating temperatures exceeding 600 $^\circ$C. It consists of an array of helically coiled absorber tubes contained side-by-side within an insulated groove having a rectangular windowed opening. Secondary concentrating optics are incorporated to boost the geometric concentration ratio to 97x. The multiple absorber tubes are connected via two axial pipes serving as feeding and collecting manifolds. The steady-state energy conservation equation coupling radiation, convection, and conduction is formulated and solved numerically using the finite volume technique. The solar flux distribution incident at each absorber tube is determined by Monte Carlo ray-tracing using spectrally and directionally dependent optical properties. Thermal radiative heat exchange is analyzed using the gray-band approximated radiosity method for an enclosure with a selective window. Model validation is accomplished by comparison to on-sun experiments with a 1 m-long solar receiver prototype composed of 7 absorber tubes, mounted on a 4.85 m-aperture solar trough concentrator. Feeding rates in the range of 5-20 ln/min to each absorber tube led to air outlet temperatures of 621-449 $^\circ$C and a peak receiver efficiency of 64%. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Design and optimization of a solar power plant are very complex and require many calculations, data and time. From this point of view, artificial neural network (ANN) models are desired options to determine techno-economic performances of this kind of plants. Therefore, the objective of this study is to investigate the feed-forward back-propagation learning algorithm with three different variants; Levenberge Marguardt (LM), Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG), and Pola-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (CGP), used in the \{ANN\} to find the best approach for prediction and techno-economic optimization of parabolic trough solar thermal power plant (PTSTPP) integrated with fuel backup system and thermal energy storage. The obtained statistical parameters showed that \{LM\} algorithm with 38 neurons in a single hidden layer looks as the best \{ANN\} model to predict the annual power generation ( \{PG\} net ) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the presented PTSTPP. Moreover, the obtained weights from this topology were used in the \{LCOE\} analysis for determining the optimum system design. It is therefore available to get a minimum \{LCOE\} of 8.88 Cent/kWh from the new optimized plant when the plant characteristics are; 34$^\circ$C and 850 W/m2 for both design ambient temperature and solar radiation, 23 m for row spacing, 1.7 for solar multiple, and 2.5 h number of hours for the storage system. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study investigates numerically, in terms of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), a Parabolic Trough Collector (PTC) system with nanofluid as the Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF). All the heat transfer mechanisms were taken into account to simulate the \{SEGS\} LS2-module PTC. The validation process showed very good agreement between the numerical results and the available test results from four typical testing conditions, with the use of Syltherm 800 liquid oil. Specifically, the maximum relative error observed for outlet temperature was 0.3% and 7.3% for the collector efficiency. In order to address the nanofluid modeling problem the two-phase approach was preferred (against single-phase) and validated against experimental and numerical results for a circular tube under constant wall temperature. Overall, a total of 20 different simulation cases were performed for the \{LS2\} module, for a range of nanoparticle (Al2O3) concentrations (0%-4%), thus making it possible for a parametric evaluation on the \{LS2\} efficiency. In addition, the temperature and velocity fields of the Syltherm 800/Al2O3 nanofluid were associated with the enhanced heat transfer occurring at higher nanoparticle concentrations. A boost up to 10% on the collector efficiency was reported for Al2O3 concentration of 4%, which is in accordance with relevant studies. },

With the 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T system, the characteristic parameters of the space solar cell under non-concentrating solar radiation and concentrating solar radiation are respectively tested experimentally, and the solar cell output characteristics at different opening widths of concentrating mirror of the PV/T stage under condensation are also tested experimentally. When the mirror opening width was 57 cm, the solar cell efficiency reached maximum value of 5.21%. The experimental platform of the two-stage photovoltaic thermal system was established, with a 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T stage and a 15 m2 mirror heating stage, or a 1.8 m2 mirror PV/T stage and a 30 m2 mirror heating stage. The results showed that with single cycle, the long metal cavity heating stage would bring lower thermal efficiency, but temperature rise of the working medium is higher, up to 12.06 掳C with only single cycle. With 30 min closed multiple cycles, the temperature of the working medium in the water tank was 62.8 $^\circ$C, with an increase of 28.7 $^\circ$C, and thermal energy with higher temperature could be output. },

  Abstract                 = {In this study, performance assessment of a novel system based on parabolic trough solar collectors and an organic Rankine cycle for combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) is presented. In this system, a portion of the waste heat is used for heating through a heat exchanger and the other portion is used for cooling through a single-effect absorption chiller. This study considers three modes of operation: a solar mode, which is characterized by a low-solar radiation; a solar and storage mode, which is characterized by a high-solar radiation; and a storage mode, which is the operation of the system at night time through a thermal storage tank subsystem. To assess the performance improvement of the present system, three further cases are considered: electrical power, cooling-cogeneration, and heating-cogeneration. This system is designed to produce 500 kW of electricity. Different output parameters-efficiency, net electrical power, and electrical to heating and cooling ratios-are examined in this study. This study reveals that the maximum electrical efficiency for the solar mode is 15%, for the solar and storage mode is 7%, and for the storage mode is 6.5%. Alternatively, when \{CCHP\} is used, the efficiency increases significantly. The maximum \{CCHP\} efficiency for the solar mode is 94%, for the solar and storage mode is 47%, and for the storage mode is 42%. Furthermore, this study shows that the electrical to cooling ratio is sensitive to the change in the \{ORC\} pump inlet temperature. Therefore, the variation in this temperature could be used as a good control for the amount of the cooling power needed. },

Knowledge of the dynamic behavior of such system is particularly important as changes in inlet water conditions or in the solar radiation affect the amount of steam generated in the solar field. The process must therefore be controlled to ensure constant quality of produced steam. This work introduces a computational fluid dynamic simulation approach to predict the behavior of a solar steam generating system, which is located at the Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain. The STAR-CCM+ code has been used to implement an efficient multiphase model capable of simulating the dynamics of the multiphase fluid in parabolic-trough solar collectors.

It is indicated through the analyses that this compensation method is very applicable for regions with the latitude over 25$^\circ$ (especially over 30$^\circ$) and short trough collectors. In order to verify the feasibility of the compensation method, a five-meter PTC-HNSA experimental system was built. The increased thermal efficiency of the experimental system is measured, and the result that the experimental value (increased thermal efficiency) substantially agreed with the theoretical value (increased optical efficiency) is gained. All these works can offer some valuable references to the further study on high-efficiency trough solar concentrating systems. },

Some basic rules, such as the solar collector efficiency increases with the increase of the solar flux and the flow rate of the heat transfer fluid, and decreases with the increase of the inlet temperature of the HTF, are obtained, which indicates the \{LSSVM\} method is competent to optimize the solar collector systems. As a result, the new approach will provide meaningful data for developing the parabolic trough solar thermal power plant in China. },
