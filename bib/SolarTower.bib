	Abstract = {Abstract Simulations were carried out to predict the performance of a Solar Rankine Cycle (SRC) and an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) when combined with two different solar field configurations based on parabolic trough and power tower systems. For the selected cases, yearly plant performance was computed under real operating conditions on a one hour basis. A computing procedure was developed by integrating two commercial softwares with in-house computer code. Thermodynamic performance was featured for every plant configuration both at nominal and part load conditions. A single reheat regenerative Rankine cycle was chosen for the \{SRC\} plant whereas a commercial gas turbine, i.e. Siemens SGT-800, with a dual pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) was assumed for the \{ISCC\} plant. As far as the heat transfer fluid (HTF) is concerned, molten salt was chosen to transfer heat to the water loop in the SRC. Synthetic oil was considered in the \{ISCC\} plant. Plants were assumed to be located in a Southern Spain site. The comparative analysis was mainly focused on the influence of \{CSP\} technology on global solar energy conversion efficiency of both \{SRC\} and \{ISCC\} plants. Special attention was devoted to assess trough collectors (PTCs) against the solar tower (ST) system in terms of intercepted radiation and thermal power sent to the power block. The \{ISCC\} coupled with a \{ST\} was found to assure the highest annual solar-to-electric efficiency of 21.8%. This is the result of both higher collection efficiency of \{ST\} compared to \{PTCs\} and higher conversion efficiency of solar energy introduced into the combined cycle, as compared to SRC. },

	Abstract = {The aim of this work was to propose a novel system combines both solar chimney and thermo siphon solar tower systems. To this end, theoretical study to the proposed system was conducted. In this new system, the solar tower was installed at the exit of the solar chimney. The results of the theoretical study showed that, the new system generates more power compared with the conventional system. It was found that the maximum power extracted from the new system was about two times that obtained from the conventional system at the same height, for the specified range studied in this work. In addition, it was found that the new system has higher overall efficiency and generates higher speeds of air at the chimney inlet. This increase in both maximum power and air speed at the chimney inlet from the new system is enhanced with the rise in solar irradiance, radius of collector, and ratio of solar tower height to solar chimney height. Moreover, the results indicated that there is a certain ratio between solar tower length and width at which the maximum extracted mechanical power reached a maximum value for the specified parameters of solar irradiance, collector radius, height of chimney, and height of solar tower.

	Abstract = {A novel modeling tool for calculation of central receiver concentrated flux distributions is presented, which takes into account drift effects. This tool is based on a drift model that includes different geometrical error sources in a rigorous manner and on a simple analytic approximation for the individual flux distribution of a heliostat. The model is applied to a group of heliostats of a real field to obtain the resulting flux distribution and its variation along the day. The distributions differ strongly from those obtained assuming the ideal case without drift or a case with a Gaussian tracking error function. The time evolution of peak flux is also calculated to demonstrate the capabilities of the model. The evolution of this parameter also shows strong differences in comparison to the case without drift.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Heat loss is an important factor in predicting the performance of solar receiver of concentrated solar power (CSP) systems. This study presents a numerical simulation calculating convection and radiation heat losses from four different receiver shapes including external and cavity type receivers with different opening ratios (ratio of cavity aperture area to receiver area). The simulation was carried out using Fluent \{CFD\} (computational fluid dynamics) software considering three different receiver temperatures (600, 750, and 900 $\,^{\circ}$C), three wind velocities (1, 5, and 10 m/s), and two wind directions (head-on and side-on). The simulation results were then used for deriving a simplified correlation model which gives the fraction of convection heat loss by a function of opening ratio, receiver temperature, and wind velocity. The calculated fraction can be easily converted to convection heat loss, total heat loss, or receiver efficiency once the radiation heat loss is estimated by any applicable prediction model. Calculated heat loses by the proposed simple correlation model showed good agreements with the simulation results with 11.4% and 5.9% average absolute deviations for convection heat loss and total heat loss, respectively. Validation of the model with experimental data was also carried out using test results available from three central receiver systems (Martin Marietta, Solar One and Solar Two). },

@article{Besarati2014,
	Abstract = {A number of codes have been developed in order to optimize the heliostat field layout for solar power tower plants. These codes are intended to improve calculation accuracy as well as computational time. Of all the factors that need to be taken into account in these codes, shading and blocking calculations introduce significant complexity as they are computationally intensive. In this paper, a new and simple method is proposed to identify the heliostats with the greatest potential for shadowing and blocking a heliostat. Using the new method, the computational time is considerably reduced as unnecessary calculations are avoided. The Sassi method [1] is then used to calculate the shading and blocking efficiency. The results are compared with the literature and good agreement is obtained. As a case study, the paper also investigates optimization of a 50MWth heliostat field layout for Dagget, California. Yearly insolation weighted efficiency is selected as the objective function while two parameters of the prophylaxis pattern [2], which define the shape of the field layout, are the design variables. The acceptance angle of the cavity receiver and distance between the adjacent heliostats are the physical constraints which are included in the optimization. The optimization algorithm is explained in detail and the optimal field layout is presented. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Ramos2012,
	Abstract = {A method for optimizing a central receiver solar thermal electric power plant is studied. We parametrize the plant design as a function of eleven design variables and reduce the problem of finding optimal designs to the numerical problem of finding the minimum of a function of several variables. This minimization problem is attacked with different algorithms both local and global in nature. We find that all algorithms find the same minimum of the objective function. The performance of each of the algorithms and the resulting designs are studied for two typical cases. We describe a method to evaluate the impact of design variables in the plant performance. This method will tell us what variables are key to the optimal plant design and which ones are less important. This information can be used to further improve the plant design and to accelerate the optimization procedure. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {A new method for the design of the heliostat field layout for solar tower power plant is proposed. In the new method, the heliostat boundary is constrained by the receiver geometrical aperture and the efficiency factor which is the product of the annual cosine efficiency and the annual atmospheric transmission efficiency of heliostat. With the new method, the annual interception efficiency does not need to be calculated when places the heliostats, therefore the total time of design and optimization is saved significantly. Based on the new method, a new code for heliostat field layout design (HFLD) has been developed and a new heliostat field layout for the PS10 plant at the PS10 location has been designed by using the new code. Compared with current PS10 layout, the new designed heliostats have the same optical efficiency but with a faster response speed. In addition, to evaluate the feasibility of crops growth on the field land under heliostats, a new calculation method for the annual sunshine duration on the land surface is proposed as well. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A new module for the analysis of the aspherical heliostat is created in the new code. A new toroidal heliostat field is designed and analyzed by using the new code. Compared with the spherical heliostat, the solar image radius of the field is reduced by about 30{\%} by using the toroidal heliostat if the mirror shape and the tracking are ideal. In addition, to maximize the utilization of land, suitable crops can be considered to be planted under heliostats.
